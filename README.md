# avax-dex-ui-v4
This is a web-based single page app (SPA) written in React. It's forked from [bch-wallet-web3-android](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-wallet-web3-android), and has been adapted to work with the Avalanche (AVAX) blockchain, and act as a user interface for avax-dex. [avax-dex](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/avax-dex) is a REST API that allows for free, uncensorable exchange of tokens on the Avalanche X-chain.
